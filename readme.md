# Flowcontrol

- [Documentation](https://docs.rs/flowcontrol)

General purpose macros and utilities for expediting and clarifying control flow in rust.

- `shed!` - stop `break`s

- `superif!` - like if with multi-statement, branching conditionals

- `ta_return!` - type assert a block's return value (ex: in async blocks, closures)
